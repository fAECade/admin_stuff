Here is what I did until now:

Created a new account on github: wandad
Logged in via fAECade account to add repository admin_stuff
Added user Wandad as collaborator to aec and admin_stuff
Wrote this

Next steps:
Uploading of some documents for your review.

Some Infos that might be useful for other github newbies:

#Getting a copy of your github repo (this can be used for example to get aec or this repo)
git clone [clone_url] where [clone_url] is something like git@github.com:johndoe/myproject.git

#some useful commands I needed for creating this repo
git add README                   #Adds README to an empty repo
git commit -m "check in comment" #at the moment this is only a local commit
git remote add origin git@github.com:fAECade/admin_stuff.git #I guess this sets origin to the path so that
git push origin master                                       # works
